\begin{frontmatter}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This particular document provides a skeleton illustrating key sections for a Lessons Learned document.
Please see the sample \texttt{sample-document.tex} in \url{github.com/livecomsjournal/article_templates/templates} for additional information on and examples of using the LiveCoMS LaTeX class.
Here we also assume familiarity with LaTeX and knowledge of how to include figures, tables, etc.; if you want examples, see the sample just referenced.

In your work, in this particular slot, please provide an abstract of no more than 250 words.
Your abstract should explain the main contributions of your article, and should not contain any material that is not included in the main text.
Please note that your abstract, plus the authorship material following it, must not extend beyond the title page or modifications to the LaTeX class will likely be needed.
\end{abstract}

\end{frontmatter}




\section{Introduction}

Here you would explain what problem you are tackling and briefly motivate your work.
Since a Lessons Learned document provides negative results in a particular category, you will want to clearly define your category and also motivate the application of your work to your particular problem.

We suggest that you envision your document potentially extending in the future to include other Lessons Learned in the same category, so you may want to organize your work in a way which would allow this type of extension (e.g. providing a general introduction then using subsections to explain your particular problem) -- for example, describing potential of mean force calculations generally, then in a subsection motivating your particular application of them.

In this particular template, we have removed most of the usage examples which occur in \texttt{sample-document.tex} to provide a minimal template you can modify; however, we retain a couple of examples illustrating more unusual features of our templates/article class, such as the checklists, and information on algorithms and pseudocode.

A Lessons Learned document is a regular scientific article, and should be prepared with similar organization.
Sample typical section headers follow.

\section{Theory and Methods}

You should use a section (or separate sections, if this yields better organization) to describe the theory and methods relevant to your work.

This should include all information required for a reader to reproduce the results, including software version numbers and links to any in-house files or scripts

\section{Results}

You would give your results here.
Since the goal here is not just to present negative results, but also to provide lessons learned from doing so, you will want to make sure you have data to show why your approach failed.

\section{Discussion}

Discussion should highlight the lessons learned and give tips for avoiding future mistakes.
Try to tell readers what you wish you had known before starting.

\section{Conclusions}

Give conclusions.


\section{Author Contributions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This section mustt describe the actual contributions of

% predefined roles as might be done in other journals.
