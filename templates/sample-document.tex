% This provides a checklist which

\begin{Checklists*}[p!]

\begin{checklist}{First list}
\textbf{You can easily make full width checklists that take a whole page}

Guidelines can be included for standard research article sections, such as this one.

\section{Some \LaTeX{} Examples}
\label{sec:examples}

Use section and subsection commands to organize your document. \LaTeX{} handles all the formatting and numbering automatically. Use ref and label commands for cross-references.

\subsection{Figures and Tables}

Use the table and tabular commands for basic tables --- see \TABLE{example}, for example.

To include an image (JPEG, PNG or PDF) in your document, use the \verb|\includegraphics| command as in the code for \FIG{view}.

If you use the following prefixes for your \verb|\label|:
%
\begin{description}
\item[Figures] \texttt{fig:}, e.g.~\verb|\label{fig:view}|
\item[Tables] \texttt{tab:}, e.g.~\verb|\label{tab:example}|
\item[Equations] \texttt{eq:}, e.g.~\verb|\label{eq:CLT}|
\item[Boxes] \texttt{box:}, e.g.~\verb|\label{box:simple}|
\end{description}
%
you can then use the convenience commands \verb|\FIG{view}|, \verb|\TABLE{example}|, \verb|\EQ{CLT}| and \verb|\BOX{simple}| \emph{without} the label prefixes, to generate cross-references \FIG{view}, \TABLE{example}, \EQ{CLT} and \BOX{simple}. Alternatively, use \verb|\autoref| with the full label, e.g.~\autoref{first:app} (although this may not work correctly for figures and tables in the appendices or boxes nor supplements at present).

Really wide figures or tables, that take up the entire text width: use \verb|\begin{figure*}...\end{figure*}| as in \FIG{fullwidth}. And sometimes you may want to use feature boxes like \BOX{simple}.

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{elife-18156-fig2}
\caption{A very wide figure that takes up the entire page, including the gutter space.}
\label{fig:fullwidth}
\figsupp{There is no limit on the number of Figure Supplements for any one primary figure. Each figure supplement should be clearly labeled, Figure 1--Figure Supplement 1, Figure 1--Figure Supplement 2, Figure 2--Figure Supplement 1 and so on, and have a short title (and optional legend). Figure Supplements should be referred to in the legend of the associated primary figure, and should also be listed at the end of the article text file.}{\includegraphics[width=6cm]{frog}}
\end{figure*}


\subsection{Algorithms and Pseudocode}

The \texttt{algpseudocode} and \texttt{algorithms} packages is loaded by the document class. \ALG{euclid} was taken directly from the package documentation. (Please do not load \texttt{algorithm2e}; it's not compatible with \texttt{algpseudocde} nor \texttt{algorithms}!)

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Euclid's algorithm}\label{alg:euclid}
\begin{algorithmic}%[1]  %% uncomment to enable line numbers
\Procedure{Euclid}{$a,b$}\Comment{The g.c.d. of a and b}
   \State $r\gets a\bmod b$
   \While{$r\not=0$}\Comment{We have the answer if r is 0}
      \State $a\gets b$
      \State $b\gets r$
      \State $r\gets a\bmod b$
   \EndWhile\label{euclidendwhile}
   \State \textbf{return} $b$\Comment{The gcd is b}
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}


\subsection{Citations}

LaTeX formats citations and references automatically using the bibliography records in your .bib file, which you can edit via the project menu. Use the \verb|\cite| command for an inline citation, like \cite{McQuilton01012012}, and the \verb|\citep| command for a citation in parentheses \citep{Aivazian917}. The LaTeX template uses a slightly-modified Vancouver bibliography style.

\begin{featurebox}
\caption{This is an example feature box}
\label{box:simple}
This is a feature box. It floats!
\medskip

\includegraphics[width=5cm]{example-image}
\featurefig{`Figure' and `table' captions in feature boxes should be entered with \texttt{\textbackslash featurefig} and \texttt{\textbackslash featuretable}. They're not really floats.}

\lipsum[1]
\end{featurebox}

\subsection{Mathematics}

\LaTeX{} is great at typesetting mathematics. Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with $\text{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and $\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:CLT}
S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
      = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i
\end{equation}
denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge in distribution to a normal $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.

\lipsum[3]

\begin{figure}[hbt!]
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{elife-13214-fig7}
\caption{A column-width example.}
\label{fig:view}
%% If the optional argument in the square brackets is ``none'', then the caption *will not appear in the main figure at all* and only the full caption will appear under the supplementary figure at the end of the manuscript.
\figsupp[Shorter caption for main text.]{This is a supplementary figure's full caption, which will be used at the end of the manuscript.}{\includegraphics[width=6cm]{frog}}
\figsupp{This is another supplementary figure.}{\includegraphics[width=6cm]{frog}}
\figdata{This is a description of a data source.}
\figdata{This is another description of a data source.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Other Chemistry Niceties}

You can use commands from the \texttt{mhchem} and \texttt{siunitx} packages. For example: \ce{C32H64NO7S}; \SI{5}{\micro\metre}; \SI{30}{\degreeCelsius}; \SI{5e-17}{\Molar}

\subsection{Lists}

You can make lists with automatic numbering \dots

\begin{enumerate}
\item Like this,
\item and like this.
\end{enumerate}
\dots or bullet points \dots
\begin{itemize}
\item Like this,
\item and like this.
\end{itemize}
\dots or with words and descriptions \dots
\begin{description}
\item[Word] Definition
\item[Concept] Explanation
\item[Idea] Text
\end{description}

Some filler text, because empty templates look really poor. \lipsum[1]

\section{Author Contributions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This section mustt describe the actual contributions of
% author. Since this is an electronic-only journal, there is
% no length limit when you describe the authors' contributions,

% for more information on deciding on authorship and author order.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
FMS wrote sections X and Z. RMS contributed to the writing of sections
Y and W.  TMP contributed to the writing of sections Y and W. ITP

and analyzed the experiments in Z, made figures 4-6, and edited the
whole manuscript as well as standardizing table formatting.
